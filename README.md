# Java-Swing-Modern-Calculator

This repository contains a Modern Calculator GUI application built entirely in Java Swing. The project serves as an excellent, practical demonstration of creating a functional desktop application with a focus on a user-friendly interface and robust mathematical logic. It features a sleek dark-mode aesthetic using custom color palette definitions, and it utilizes JFrame, JTextField, and a GridLayout managed by a JPanel for its structure. All button interactions are handled through the ActionListener interface, which contains the core logic for number entry, operator selection, and calculation. A key highlight is the custom MouseAdapter implementation that provides a visual hover effect for buttons, enhancing the user experience. The calculator supports standard arithmetic operations, chained calculations, and essential utilities like sign toggling, backspace (Del), and full clear (C), complete with basic error handling for issues like division by zero. This is a perfect project for Java developers learning GUI programming and event handling.
